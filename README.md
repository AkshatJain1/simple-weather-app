Do you ever wish you could easily just see what temperature it is outside without having to load up your native phone weather app and seeing a bunch of random numbers all over the place?

Well here is Simple Weather App to solve all your problems! Simply launch the app and see in big numbers what the weather is outside. So easy right?
